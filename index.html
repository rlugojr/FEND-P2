                <p>Homo Sapien exist in all shapes, sizes and many different colors.  Although their brain is larger and more complex than that of other animals, they often spend their lives comparing themselves to one another, slurping Half-Caff Mocha Latte's while sending messages to each other through a small communication device (even if they are in the same location and until they develop antennae through evolution) Their days are usually consumed with activities that allow them to collect as many sheets of rectangular paper as possible until they feel they have collected enough to buy "happiness" (an "emotion", a.k.a an abstract state of mind caused by a chemical reaction in the brain which leads to a shift in mood)  or until they "have more" collected than the other Homo Sapiens around them, which usually causes them to grin incessently until another group of Homo Sapiens takes away said collection of paper through a form of social structure called a "tax audit". As the most intelligent animal (as far as they are concerned), it is very ironic that Homo Sapien quite often forgets, or refuses to accept, that it, itself, is an "animal."</p>
