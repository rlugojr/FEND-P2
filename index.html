                            <p>The <em><strong>Homo Sapien</em></strong> exists in all shapes, sizes and many different colors.  Although, their brain is larger and more complex than that of other animals, they often spend their lives comparing themselves to other Homo Sapiens, slurping Half-Decaf Mocha Caramel Latte's while sending messages to each other through a small communication device (even if they are in the same location and until they develop antennae through evolution)</p>
                            <p> However, there is one in particular, they call <em><strong>The Dude</strong></em> who does not abide!  He is happy to be in his apartment, with his TV, sitting in his favorite chair,where he can admire the rug that ties it all together.  The rug, the one cosmic force that brings all the worldly items into one interconnected synergy.</P>
                            <p>The Dude, (also known as "His Dudeness", "Duder", or "El Dudorino", is quite comfortable and docile unless provoked.  Whatever the cost, <em>do not spill his "White Russian" and never, ever mess with his rug</em>.  <strong>The Dude does not abide!</strong></p>
                            <p>Oh, and he is a <em><strong>Homo Sapien</em></strong>, which is in the <em>"Order Primate, Class Mammalia, Phylum Chordata, and the Kingdom Animalia"</em>, which makes the Dude actually an <strong>Animal</strong>, but hey, well that's just like...Your opinion, man.</p>
