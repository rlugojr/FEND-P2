# Homo Sapien Dudericus
##FEND-P2 Animal Trading Card Submission

The most majectic of creatures - The Dude, or The Dude, (or El Duderino, if you're not into brevity) is an extremely rare card and has never been ownd by anyone.  This card just ends up migrating from TV chair to bowling alley in a most strange and non-chalant manner.

Please read both sides of the card and learn about this magnificent creature.  If you find that you don't really care much for the Big Leboski, well, Hey, that's like...your opinion.

:-P
